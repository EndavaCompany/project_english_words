The application was created using JAVA 8 and the package manager MAVEN. The project has a class named Dictionary with the
method isEnglishWord, it was mocked. We had created the auxiliary class WordFinder to find the English words in the original
input. And finally, we have a class WordFinderTest to test the project functionality, in this test we mocked the method 
isEnglishWord in the class Dictionary and we prove the cases for an example input, and possibles words.
